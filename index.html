				<h2>Hello Everyone</h2>
				<p>My name is Ilya.</p>
				<p>I will tell about the Serverless Computing</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<section>
					<p>
						<span style="color: blue">Serverless computing</span>, or more simply <span
							style="color: blue">Serverless</span>, is a hot topic in the software architecture world.
						The “Big Three” cloud vendors — Amazon, Google, and Microsoft — are heavily invested in
						Serverless, and we’ve seen open-source projects, conferences, and software vendors dedicated to
						the subject.
						But what is Serverless, and why is (or isn’t) it worth considering?
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Like many trends in software, there’s no one clear view of what Serverless is. For starters, it
						encompasses two different but overlapping areas:
					</p>
					<ol style="font-size: 0.8em">
						<li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="0">Serverless was first used to describe
							applications that significantly or fully incorporate
							third-party, cloud-hosted applications and services, to manage server-side logic and state.
							These types of services described as <span style="color: yellow">“(Mobile) Backend as a
								Service"</span>, and use <span style="color: yellow">"BaaS"</span> as
							shorthand.
						</li>
						<li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="1">Sometimes serverless computing is called
							<span style="color: yellow">Function as a Service
								(FaaS)</span>, because the granularity of the code that you build is a function. The
							platform executes your function on
							its own server and orchestrates the process between function requests and function
							responses.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>BaaS and FaaS are related in their operational attributes (example, no resource management) and
					are frequently used together.

					<h3>A couple of examples</h3>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>To get an idea for how serverless computing works, let's start with the serverless computing
						execution model, which is illustrated in Figure.</p>
					<div>
						<img src="images/execution model.jpg" class="Exrcution-model"
							alt="Serverless computing execution model">
					</div>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p>
						Here's the serverless execution model in a nutshell:
					</p>
					<ol style="font-size: 0.8em">
						<li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="0">
							<p>A client makes a request to the serverless
								computing platform to execute a specific function.</p>
						</li>
						<li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="1">The serverless computing platform first
							checks to see if the function is running on any of its servers. If the function isn't
							already running, then the platform loads the function from a data store</li>
						<li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="2">The platform then deploys the function to
							one of its servers, which are preconfigured with an execution environment that can run the
							function.</li>
						<li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="3">Server executes the function and captures
							the result.</li>
						<li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="4">It returns the result back to the client.
						</li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p style="font-size: 1.2em; margin-top: 0">This example demonstrates another very important point
						about Serverless architectures. </p>
					<div class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="0" style="text-align: justify">In the
						original version, <span style="color: blue">all flow, control, and security</span> <span
							style=" color: yellow">was managed by the central server
							application.</span></div>
					<div class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="1" style="text-align: justify"> In the the
						Serverless version there is no central arbiter</div>

						FaaS in Amazon Web Services
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p style="font-size: 1.3em; color: yellowgreen">About AWS Lambda</p>
					<div class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="0">
						<p style="text-align: justify">
							AWS Lambda lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. (1) ... With Lambda,
							you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service (2) - all with
							zero administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to
							run (3) and scale (4) your code with high availability. You can set up your code to
							automatically trigger from other AWS services (5) or call it directly from any web or mobile
							app.
						</p>
					</div>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p style="font-size: 1.3em; color: yellowgreen">What does it mean?</p>
					<ol style="font-size: 0.7em;text-align: justify">
						<li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="0">Fundamentally, FaaS is about running
							backend code without managing your own server systems or your own long-lived server
							applications.</li>
						<li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="1">FaaS offerings do not require coding to a
							specific framework or library. FaaS functions are regular applications when it comes to
							language and environment. </li>
						<li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="2">In a FaaS environment we upload the code
							for our function to the FaaS provider, and the provider does everything else necessary for
							provisioning resources, , managing processes, etc.</li>
						<li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="3">Horizontal scaling is completely automatic,
							elastic, and managed by the provider.</li>
						<li class="fragment visible" data-fragment-index="4">Functions in FaaS are typically triggered
							by event types defined by the provider. </li>
					</ol>
				</section>
				<section>
					<p style="font-size: 1.3em; color: yellowgreen">Execution duration</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify ">
						FaaS functions are typically limited in how long each invocation is allowed to run. At present
						the “timeout” for an AWS Lambda function to respond to an event is at most five minutes, before
						being terminated. Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Functions have similar limits.
					</p>
					<p style="text-align: justify ">This means that certain classes of long-lived tasks are not suited
						to FaaS functions without
						re-architecture

				</section>
				<section data-fragment-index="1">
					<p style="text-align: justify">Serverless, despite
						the confusing name, is a style of architecture where
						we rely on running our
						own server-side systems as part of our applications to a smaller extent than usual. We do this
						through two techniques: BaaS, where we tightly integrate third-party remote application services
						directly into the frontend of our apps, and FaaS, which moves server-side code from long-running
						components to ephemeral function instances.</p>
